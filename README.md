Demonstration of interactive, tabbed data tables
This Shiny application is designed to demonstrate some features                   
 incorporated in the IeDEA Harmonist Toolkit:                                      
   1. Summarizing a dataframe in tabbed tables (dynamically)                       
   2. Adding functioning buttons in each table row                                 
   3. Presenting a modal containing the details related to the clicked row         
                                                                                   
 [Jeremy Stephens](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/JeremyStephens) contributed the tabbed table method                               
 The idea for clicking on summary tables for detail came from Barbara              
 Borges at Rstudio::conf2018 [https://github.com/bborgesr/rstudio-conf-2018](https://github.com/bborgesr/rstudio-conf-2018)           
 but that approach doesn't work for tabbed tables.                                 
 I learned about adding functioning buttons in tables here: [https://bit.ly/2IkKuwZ](https://bit.ly/2IkKuwZ)  
 Note that "tables" in this code refers to IeDEA observational data tables.
